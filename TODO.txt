  - Exporting Final Builds:
    -Allow the user to export their project as a standalone playable   
     build. Even if this just packages the HTML, JS, and asset files 
     into a zip, it gives creators a way to share their "game" with 
     others who can run it locally.

- Real-time Validation/Feedback (Super Optional)
  - The editor can analyze the map and provide immediate feedback:
    - Is there a player start placed? If not, show a warning.
    - Are there unreachable areas or isolated sections with no path from the player start? Highlight     them, prompting the designer to adjust.
    - If certain rules must be followed (e.g., at least one exit), the editor can notify the user if the conditions arenâ€™t met.
